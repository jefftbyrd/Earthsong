## EARTH SONG is...

- a portal for exploring the sounds of other places
- a tool for sonic inspiration
- a surprising and unpredictable sonic adventure

## What does it do?

- Listen to sounds from anywhere on Earth
- Discover surprising interactions and harmonies between sounds
- Build your own soundscapes in EARTH SONG's interactive 3-dimensional Sound Portal
- Mutate and transform sounds in real-time: reverse direction, change playback speed, "tune" sounds to each other

## How does it work?

- Choose a place to explore by selecting a point on the map
- EARTH SONG searches [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/) - a massive collaborative database of user-contributed audio recordings - for sounds from that location
- 5 sounds are selected at random and loaded into the EARTH SONG Sound Portal, a sonic playground where you can audition, manipulate and mix sounds to create your own custom sound environment
- Registered users can save and recall their favorite journeys

## Technologies

- Next.js
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Node.js with RESTful API
- PostgreSQL
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for animation and sound visualization.
- [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) for sound playback and manipulation.
- [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) for the interactive globe.
- Sounds are sourced from [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/), a collaborative database of user-contributed audio content. All sounds are released under Creative Commons licenses that allow their reuse.
